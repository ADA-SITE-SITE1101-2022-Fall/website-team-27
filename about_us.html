        <p>
            My name is Jamila Gasimova. I am first year student at ADA university and my major is Computer Science. My decision to choose a degree like this was done by inspiration of the opportunities that it could give. For example working in big companies such as “Linkedin”, “Google”, “Amazon” etc. Here is my e-mail: <strong>jgasimova17198@ada.edu.az </strong> In case of any questions. Hope it was interesting to read about our team and the event “Hour of Code”.
